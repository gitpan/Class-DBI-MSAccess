README for Class-DBI-MSAccess

This is a simple subclass of Class::DBI which makes CDBI work correctly with
Microsoft Access databases.  I've only tested this module when connecting to
the Access database with DBD::ODBC.  MS Access 2000 or more recent is required
(so that we can use "SELECT @@IDENTITY" to correctly locate the new value for
AutoNumber primary key columns).

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
